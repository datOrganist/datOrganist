- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @datOrganist
  -Having a PhD in nursing science with clear focus on quantiative methods
  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all kinds of weird statistics. Coming from a field with loads of messy and low-level (nominal-ordinal) data, 
      I found my fun in statistics and methods beyond the mainstream. 
      
      Methods and Topics of past projects:
      - Questionnary and instrument design 
      - Item response theory (esp. Latent Class Analysis)
      - Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)
      - Inter-rater reliability/aggreement measures (Cohen's (weighted) Kappa, Asymmetrical Kappa, Bangdiwala's B)
      - Dispersion of low level data (Standard deviation from mode (SDM))
      
      
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a postdoc in a socio-medical field at the Heidelberg university clinic.
